# Social-Network-API-FDH

AS A social media startup, an API was created for my social network using NoSQL database.  So, that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

GIVEN a social network API, when I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Thunder Client, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database. When testing the API POST and DELETE routes in Thunder Client, then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
